<h5 style="background-color:White;font-family:Arial;font-size:20;"><font color="Red"> The Knhs has entered so many Extra-curriculars like Division school press conference and sometimes we proceed to regional And to National, The Regional festival of talents also we proceed to national and so many more extra-curriculars,<br>
But did you know who are the contestants their? They are the SPA students the SPA curriculum is for the students that have the ability to balance their talents with their academic skills.
In KNHS we have here we called SPECIALLIZATION from the word "special" it was a big previlage,<br>but sometimes we didn't call it SPECIALLIZATION we call it "Discipline".<br>
We also have 7 Disciplines in SPA like Dance,Vocals,Instrumentals,Media,Visual,Creative, and Theatre.
In this 7 disciplines we should not only focus on our academics we should balance our academic life and our discipline life,<br>because we should balance our grades if we get a low Grades we can be kicked or out of SPA curriculum.
By the way SPA means Special Program in the Arts and also KNHS means Kapatagan National High School.</h5>
<h6 style="background-color:White;font-family:Arial;font-size:20;"> Let me clear this to you SPA students are not late at their classses because in their 7 subjects and teachers they will meet atleast 5 times a week.
More than that it was a previlage to be in a SPA curriculum because a SPA curriculum  is the first section in the whole "GRADING"</h6>
